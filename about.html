            A web designer's job is to build the visual appeal for a website. Meanwhile, a web developer writes code and builds the back-end functionality. It's important to understand the difference between these two roles so you can find the right person for your projects.</h3>

         <h3>Web design and development is an umbrella term that describes the process of creating a website. Like the name suggests, it involves two major skill sets: web design and web development.

         <h3>The basic tools involved in web development are programming languages called HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. There are, however, a number of other programs used to “manage” or facilitate the construction of sites that would otherwise have to be done “from scratch” by writing code. A number of content management systems (CMS) fall into this category, including WordPress, Joomla!, Drupal, TYPO3, and Adobe Experience Manager, among others.</h3>
